#### Setup

```bash
# set up vm http://mininet.org/vm-setup-notes/
# USERNAME: mininet PASSEWORD: mininet

# set up ssh 
# VirtualBox for macos: Network -> change NAT to bridged
sudo dhclient eth1
ifconfig eth1       # checks for inet addr, 
                    # use this for > ssh mininet@100.64.93.216

# https://csc.cdf.toronto.edu/mybb/archive/index.php/thread-9770-1.html
# install python-dev to so that we have `Python.h` header available for compiling ltprotocol
sudo apt-get install python-dev
# install ltprotocol manually 
git clone git://github.com/dound/ltprotocol.git
cd ltprotocol && sudo python setup.py install
# install necessary utilities
sudo apt-get install traceroute wget

# checkout ~/pox (provided by vm, not ~/cs144_lab3)
cd ~/pox && git checkout f95dd1a81584d716823bbf565fa68254416af603

### A1
# configure pox module
cd ~/cs144_lab3 && ./config.sh

# Window 1, pox controller (run it before ./run_mininet.sh)
cd ~/cs144_lab3 && ln -s ../pox && ./run_pox.sh
# Window 2, mininet
cd ~/cs144_lab3 && ./run_mininet.sh

# Window 3, test solution 
cd ~/cs144_lab3 && ./sr_solution

# make 
cd ~/cs144_lab3/router/ && make && ./sr

### A2
# configure env 
cd ~/cs144_lab5 && ./config.sh

# ~\cs144_lab5\lab5.py uses the wrong notation for functions. It uses x_y() intead of xY(). 
# So you'll need to go in and change add_host() to addHost() for example

# Also need to add in sr_nat.h and sr_nat.c for proper compilation 

# Window 1, pox controller (run it before ./run_mininet.sh)
cd ~/cs144_lab5 && ln -s ../pox && ./run_pox.sh
# Window 2, mininet
cd ~/cs144_lab5 && ./run_mininet.sh

# Window 3, test solution 
cd ~/cs144_lab5 && ./sr_nat -n
# In mininet > client ping -n 3 172.64.3.21

#### PA2 Auto tester descriptions 

+ ICMP-Traffic-[1-2] [MAX_POINTS = 2]: Generates an ICMP echo request from client to a random external host. Check two packets : 
    + 1. an ICMP echo request packet sent from NAT external interface to the external host. 
    + 2. an ICMP echo reply packet sent from NAT internal interface to the client.
+ TCP-Traffic-[1-2] [MAX_POINTS = 2]: Generates an TCP SYN packet from client to a random external host. Check two packets: 
    + 1. an TCP SYN packet sent from NAT external interface to the external host. 
    + 2. an TCP SYN-ACK packet sent from NAT internal interface to the client.
+ ICMPIndep [MAX_POINTS = 1]: Sends one ICMP echo request from client to a random external host for 10 times. 
    + Check : only one external mapping is used.
+ TCPEndpointIndependent [MAX_POINTS = 1]: Sends one TCP packet to a random external host for 10 times. 
    + Check : there should be only one port# used for the external address.
+ TCPEndpointIndependentFiltering [MAX_POINTS = 1]: Client sends a TCP SYN packet to one of the external host(exho1). Get a new mapping (internal port#, internal IP)<=>(external port#, external IP) (Letâ€™s call the external pair Pext). After that, another external host(exho2) sends a TCP SYN packet using Pext as destination (port#, IP) pair.  
    + Check : a TCP packet should be sent out via NAT internal interface with correct destination port#.
+ TCPSimultaneousOpen [MAX_POINTS = 2]: The NAT must support the following sequence of TCP packet exchanges.
    ```
    SYN ->
    <- SYN
    SYN/ACK ->
    <- SYN/ACK
    ```
+ TCPUnsolicitedSyn [MAX_POINTS = 1]: Send unsolicited SYN from one of the external hosts to the NAT external interface. It should generate an ICMP port unreachable after 6s ONLY if the destination port to which the packet is sent to is >= 1024.
+ TCPUnsolicitedSyn2 [MAX_POINTS = 1]: TCPUnsolicitedSyn to restricted external port#(22), It should generate an ICMP port unreachable message too.
+ TCPUnsolicitedSyn3 [MAX_POINTS = 1]: Send unsolicited SYN from internal host to the NAT internal interface. It should generate an ICMP port unreachable message too.


#### PA1 Auto tester descriptions 
+ init: untars the archive and starts grader
+ compile: compiles the code by running 'make'
+ ICMP-Shows-ARP-1: 
    + verifies that when the router receives an ICMP echo request, it initiates an ARP request, instead of simply swapping source IP and destination IP in the reply.
+ ARP-Request-[1-2]: 
    + sends an ARP request to one of the router's interfaces and waits for a matching ARP reply.
+ ARP-Caching-1: 
    + sends two successive -identical- ICMP echo requests to one of the router's interfaces, and makes sure that only the first one triggers an ARP request. Notes: 
        + We make sure that this is the first time that the router has to send an IP packet to this address, thus making an ARP request necessary. 
        + The second ICMP echo request is only sent after the first ICMP echo reply has been sent by the router, so there is no race condition with the ARP request / reply.
+ ICMP-Request-Forwarding-[1-2]: 
    + sends an ICMP echo request to the router. This request is not addressed to the router, which needs to forward it (the route is known). We check that the forwarded packet is identical to the original one, apart from the modified IP header.
+ ICMP-Reply-Forwarding-1: 
    + same as above but the packet forwarded is now an ICMP echo reply instead of an ICMP echo request.
+ ICMP-Reply-[1-2]: 
    + checks that the router correctly replies to ICMP echo requests addressed to one of its interfaces. This is different from earlier tests (e.g. ICMP-Shows-ARP-1), which was only interested in the ARP packets involved.
+ ICMP-TTL-Decrease-1: 
    + sends an IP packet to the router (in our case an ICMP echo request) for forwarding and makes sure that the router correctly decrements the TTL field.
+ ICMP-Reply-TTL1-1: 
    + sends an ICMP echo request addressed to one of the router's interfaces with a TTL of 1, and verifies that the router is generating a reply.
+ TCP-Forwarding-1: 
    + same as ICMP-Request-Forwarding and ICMP-Reply-Forwarding, but this time with a TCP packet instead of an ICMP packet. In other words, checks that the router correctly forwards TCP traffic.
+ UDP-Forwarding-1: 
    + same as above but this time we send a UDP packet instead of a TCP one.
+ Port-Unreachable-[1-2]: 
    + sends a TCP packet addressed to one of the router's interfaces, expects an ICMP port unreachable message.
+ Port-Unreachable-3: 
    + same as above but with a UDP packet.
+ Net-Unreachable-1: 
    + sends an ICMP packet to the router for forwarding, but makes sure that the router has no entry for the IP address. Expects an ICMP net unreachable message.
+ Net-Unreachable-2: 
    + same as above but with a TCP packet instead of an ICMP one.
+ Host-Unreachable-1: 
    + sends an ICMP packet to the router for forwarding. The router has a matching entry for the destination IP in its routing table, but the next hop is not replying to ARP requests. Expects an ICMP host unreachable message after roughly 5 seconds (5 timed out ARP requests).
+ Time-Exceed-1: 
    + sends an ICMP packet to the router for forwarding, but with a TTL of 1. The router should drop the packet and generate an ICMP Time Exceed message.
+ Time-Exceed-2: 
    + same as above but with a UDP packet instead of an ICMP one.
